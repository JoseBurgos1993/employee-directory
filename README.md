# React: Employee Directory
For this project, I created an app that takes 20 randomly generated employees from the API [randomuser](https://randomuser.me/) and allows you to sort or filter them. For a full list
of activity and commits, please visit [here](https://github.com/JoseBurgos1993/employeedirectory) as there were issues with deployment, and I had to make a new repository.

The github repository is [here](https://github.com/JoseBurgos1993/employee-directory). The deployed page can be located [here](https://joseburgos1993.github.io/employee-directory/).
